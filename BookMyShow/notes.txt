For all dependent objects -> we use annotation called @Component
but if they also do something specific -> @Repository, @Service

For controllers which support RestAPIs -> @RestController
For simple controllers which does not support REST APIs -> @Controller

DTOs are supposed to be used by Controller layer only, service and repository layer should not deal with
DTOs, they should only deal with internal models.
